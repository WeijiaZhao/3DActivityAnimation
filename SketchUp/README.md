# Avatar

This is the source code to build the SketchUp extension, which is able to receive activities information that sent from the android phone.

It also includes the 3D floor plan of Atanasoff Hall first floor which used for experiment.

To include the extension in SketchUp pro, simply copy the avatar_animation.rb file and avatar_animation folder into the pluggin folders of SketchUp.
